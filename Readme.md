## Linked List Class

I created my own link list class for fun. The class itself covers several methods like searching, removing items, geting the list size, the index of a specific value or adding in place. Furthermore, I overrode the toString() method to have a nice string representation as well.

# Planned:
-Implement a "reverse linked list" function as static method.
